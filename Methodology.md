> # Methodology
Our study involves 42 participants (Female: 16, Male: 26, Mean age:21.5 years), the age of the subjects ranges from 18 to 25. The experiment was conducted by performing various tasks such stroop color word test, identification of symmetric images, solving arithmetic questions, And a state of relaxation. 

The individual task was performed for 25 sec and 3 trials for each task were carried. Continuous EEG data has been recorded throughout the experiment.
Initially, subjects were asked to relax for 25 sec and relaxing music was played to lighten the subject. In the next phase, instructions were given for the Stroop color-word. Later, the subjects were asked to respond to the stroop colour test. Subjects, then asked to relax for 5 sec and instructions for the next task is given for next 10 sec. In the next phase, different images were shown to the subjects and asked to identify symmetric images and asymmetric images by showing gestures of thumbs and thumbs down. After then, The subjects were asked to relax again for another 5 sec and instructions for the next task were displayed for 10 sec. In the last phase of the arithmetic test, where an arithmetic problem is shown on the display and the subjects were asked to respond whether it is correct or not by showing a gesture of thumbs up and thumbs down again. The arithmetic test was also carried out for 25 sec. After the finishing of all the trials, the subjects were asked to rate the experiencing of the stress level for each test on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 indicates that the stress experienced is the lowest and 10 indicates the highest stress.

The Stroop color-word test is a neuropsychological test. It assesses the ability of cognitive interference, which occurs when processing multiple stimuli [3]. In our present work, there were two conditions 1) Congruent, where the color name presented matches exactly with the color ink that is used 2) non-Congruent, where the color name presented doesn't match with the color of ink.

Arithmetic test is a response test, which induces stress when the subject goes through solving arithmetic problems and rapid decision making. The subjects are also taught to reply with thumbs up and down movements based on whether the result displayed on the screen is a correct solution for the arithmetic issue or not in the arithmetic task.

Image symmetry test, Test was designed to induce stress, A few puzzle type shapes are drawn, and filled with color in some cases to check if two images are mirror image of each other or not, that is, symmetric or asymmetric.
