Acute stress, which is a short term stress that we deal with on a regular day to daylife. Short term stress can be positive as well as distress. Considering short termstressexposure for a long duration of time leads to serious mental disorders[8]. This turns into
Long term stress

The objective of the project is successfully achieved, that is, the proposed work is ableto determine Short term and Long term stress. For that, ample EEG signals are collectedfor both short term and long term. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is the parent
research field of the project, of which a part we have applied. The tests used intheproject are able to generate stress in the subjects inside laboratory conditions. For short
term, the features has been selected precisely and hence the classification is highfor
most of the classifiers. SVM gave the best results with an average accuracy of 76.17%and maximum of 85.95%.
