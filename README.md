Stress has become a crucially unavoidable complication that every person faces at some point of their lifespan. Researchers believe the risk of mortality in future can increase due to stress. Recognition of stress at an early stage would be a successful lead towards resolving this issue.

Acute stress, which is a short term stress that we deal with on a regular day to daylife. Short term stress can be positive as well as distress. Considering short term stress exposure for a long duration of time leads to serious mental disorders. This turns into Long term stress.


The objective of the project is successfully achieved, that is, the proposed work is able to determine Short term. For that, ample EEG signals are collected for both short term. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is the parent research field of the project, of which a part we have applied. The tests used intheproject are able to generate stress in the subjects inside laboratory conditions. For short term, the features has been selected precisely and hence the classification is highfor
most of the classifiers. SVM gave the best results with an average accuracy of 76.17%and maximum of 85.95%.
